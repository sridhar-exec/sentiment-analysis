1) To transcribe longer audio using Whisper API, usage of GPU is faster than using CPU. CPU actually takes much longer time.
2) Availability of good open-source LLMs as APIs? Some hugging face models require special requests to get access.
3) Falcon 7B is not ideal as it repeats points in output despite basic explicit prompts to not repeat. Will try prompt engineering techniques.
4) Usage of OLLAMA.
